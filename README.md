# Operating-Systems-Examples
The purpose of this file to present examples of OS style programming, this is not inteded to be provided as soultions to any homework and using this code for that purpose is not allowed.

HW1 - The objective is to create multiple processes using fork to compute a the decompression algorthim proposed by Prof. Rincon 
in this case the input file will be a text file contating any phrase or sentences the program is ran by g++ HW1.cpp > input.txt 
where input.txt is the input file. It will generate text files for each unique character with their bitstrings. The child process 
generate the compression and the parent will read the textfiles and output the final decompressed message.
